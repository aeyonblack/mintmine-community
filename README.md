## What is MintMine?

MintMine is the IDE for Market Research. We scan Reddit, GitHub, YouTube, and App Stores to find the bugs, pricing complaints, and missing features your competitors are ignoring — so you can build what users actually want.

## About This Repo

This is the public space for the MintMine community. Here you can:

- **Request features** — Tell us what you'd love to see
- **Report bugs** — Help us squash issues
- **Track progress** — See what we're working on
- **Join discussions** — Share ideas and feedback

> **Note:** MintMine's source code is not public. This repo is for community feedback only.
